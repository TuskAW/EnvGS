## Code

### Tracer

We have released the code for our 2D Gaussian ray tracer, built on the foundation of [2DGS](https://surfsplatting.github.io/) and NVIDIA OptiX, tailored for differentiable optimization and rendering tasks. Key features of this tracer include:

- **Differentiability**: The tracer is entirely differentiable, encompassing the 2D Gaussian parameters and the input ray origins and directions, should the rays be optimized.
- **Path Tracing**: It supports path tracing with multiple bounces, which is beneficial for rendering complex materials and simulating intricate light transport phenomena.
- **Customizable Rendering**: The tracer allows for customized rendering, enabling you to incorporate additional precomputed parameters and outputs tailored to your specific requirements.

Please refer to the [2D Gaussian Tracer](submodule/diff-surfel-tracing/README.md) for more details.
